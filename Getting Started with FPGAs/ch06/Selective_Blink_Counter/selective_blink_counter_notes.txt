// Notes:
I didn't realize that there was another part to this challenge and
was scrolling through to see what was next and stumbled upon the block
diagram and code for this version of the counter so I can't say the
design and code were all original based on just the requirements given.

That said, I simply referenced the block diagram when writing the below
notes and code for this version of the project. It was of course much
simpler than the LFSR version and was more along the lines of what I 
had initially started to flesh out for the LFSR code.

To make up for the fact I kinda cheated, I decided to try writing a 
testbench for this from scratch, just referencing prior testbenches
(mainly the Debounce Filter one). Everything worked with that just
fine. The only thing I want to learn / solve is the value of the LEDs
is reported as X in GTKWave; due to my ignorance of this I am unsure
if this is an error in the testbench or code or if it is an error at all.

==============================
// selective blink
1. blink led at 2Hz

- clock is 25MHz, clock cycle 40ns (1000 / 25 = 40)
- 2Hz = 500ms -> 500,000,000ns / 40ns = 12,500,000 clock cycles
- 12,500,000 = 24 bits

LIMIT=12500000

==============================
2. implement counter
- input en
- input clk
- output toggle

- reg [23:0] counter // 24 bit counter

- posedge clk
	- if enable
		- if counter == limit
			- inv toggle
			- reset counter
		- else
			- inc counter
	- else
		- toggle = 0
		
==============================
3. implement dmux
- input toggle
- input sw_1, sw_2
- output led_1, 2, 3, 4

led_1 = toggle when not sw_1, not sw_2
led_2 = toggle when sw_1, not sw_2
led_3 = toggle when not sw_1, sw_2
led_4 = toggle when sw_1, sw_2
