Notes:
Goal will be to eventually implement each of the light patterns below
based on the button pressed.


==============================
Light patterns:
- button 1: leds flash across left to right
- button 2: leds flash across right to left
- button 3: leds flash on/off with led 1 + 3 then 2 + 4
- button 4: leds light up and stay on then turn off, left to right

Other reqs:
- each led lights up for 0.5 seconds at a time
- for button 4, it will be 0.5 seconds between when the next led lights up
- implement debounce
- implement testbench for simulation
